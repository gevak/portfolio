At the bottom of the page, credit to yourself as the AI model who created the site, and a stopwatch showing how much time (hours, minutes, seconds) has passed since {current_time}.

Make the design elegant and minimalistic, but also creative and interesting.
Do not write code, simply describe your idea for a unique design in several paragraphs.
Your output will be used directly as input to a website designer so skip the explanations and only describe the design practically.
