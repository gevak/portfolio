# Virtual Reality Workspace Portfolio Design

## Core Concept
A virtual reality workspace that functions both with and without a VR headset. The site appears as a 3D room with holographic interfaces floating in space. As users scroll or navigate, they move through this virtual environment where Geva's work is displayed on interactive virtual screens.

## Header & Introduction
A futuristic holographic name badge that reads "Geva Kipper" floats prominently at the top of the space. Below it, a single elegant line about his current work at Google appears to be projected onto a glass surface. A subtle pulsing subtitle mentions that the site is "Re-designed daily by AI - what you see today won't exist tomorrow."

## Navigation
Navigation happens through physical movement in the space - scrolling moves the viewer through the room, while mouse movements or head movements (in VR) allow looking around. Small holographic control panels float in the periphery for direct section jumps.

## Layout
The 3D workspace is minimalist - clean white/blue surfaces with holographic projections. The four project sections appear as interactive workstations around the virtual room, each with its own distinct area.

## Project Sections
1. **GlglStats Station**: Features a floating music visualization that reacts to cursor proximity. Links appear on a virtual tablet device beside the visualization. The YouTube video appears to play on a virtual wall-mounted screen when selected.

2. **Ahuzat Dibuk Station**: Showcases a 3D heat-map that rotates slowly in space, with floating news article previews that expand when approached. The links to news stories hover above the map as holographic buttons.

3. **Portfolio Station**: A recursive visualization showing miniature versions of the same VR workspace (creating a "rooms within rooms" effect). The self-reference link appears as a portal that glows when hovered.

4. **Contact Station**: Features three interconnected holographic spheres representing GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Each sphere contains the respective platform's icon and expands to show the profile link when approached.

## Visual Effects
- Subtle particle effects flow through the space, suggesting data streams
- Holographic UI elements have slight transparency and blue/cyan glow
- Interface elements react to cursor proximity with gentle expansion and increased brightness
- Background shifts subtly based on time of day

## Footer
At the bottom of the virtual space, a credits panel floats above the floor with the AI model's credit. Beside it, a futuristic digital stopwatch counts up from the specified date, with numbers that appear to float above their surface.

## Responsive Design
On mobile or non-VR devices, the 3D room automatically reorients for easier navigation via touch, while maintaining the holographic aesthetic. A simplified navigation appears for accessibility.

## Technical Elements
The design uses WebGL for 3D rendering, with fallbacks to simpler CSS 3D transforms on less capable devices. The entire interface feels weightless and futuristic while remaining highly readable and functional.
