Here's a design concept for Geva Kipper's AI-redesigned portfolio website:

**Overall Aesthetic:** Minimalist, clean, and slightly offbeat, embracing the ephemeral and AI-generated nature of the site. Think Brutalist design principles meeting playful, data-driven visuals. The color palette is muted with one vibrant accent that shifts subtly each day, driven by a color generated from the current Unix timestamp.

**Hero Section:**

*   Full-screen background: a softly pulsing, procedural gradient generated with JavaScript. The gradient changes subtly each second.
*   Overlaid text: "Geva Kipper // Software Engineer at Google." (Bold, modern sans-serif). Centered.
*   Subtitle: "A portfolio constantly evolving, re-designed by AI each day." (Smaller, italicized font, positioned beneath the name).

**Project Sections:**

*   **Layout:** Four equally sized, visually distinct "cards" or sections arranged in a clean grid system. The grid layout will also adapt elegantly to mobile devices.
*   **GlglStats:**
    *   Headline: "GlglStats: Quantifying Repetition in Israeli Pop"
    *   Description: "Measures repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs using LZ77 compression. Visualizes repetition patterns in famous songs."
    *   Visual Element: A simplified, abstract visualization of a song's repetition pattern (e.g., color-coded blocks representing repeating verses/choruses).
    *   Links: "Website" (Link), "PyData TLV Talk" (Link)
    *Visual element is a thumbnail from the video.
*   **Ahuzat Dibuk:**
    *   Headline: "Ahuzat Dibuk: Tel-Aviv Parking Data Project"
    *   Description: "Collecting statistics for Tel-Aviv car parking lots, generating heat-maps for residents."
    *   Visual Element: Faded, heatmap overlay of Tel Aviv, showing carparking density.
    *   Links: "News Coverage" (links to the two articles), "Facebook Post" (Link)

*   **Meta-Portfolio:**
    *   Headline: "This AI-Generated Portfolio"
    *   Description: (Implicit) "A self-referential demonstration of dynamic web design."
    *   Visual Element: A stylized pixelated representation of the current website design.
    *   Link: "View Source" (links to the portfolio)

*   **Contact/Links:**
    *   Headline: "Connect"
    *   Description: (Optional) A short tagline like "Let's build something great!"
    *   Visual Element: A simple, animated icon representing connections (e.g., pulsating circles, flowing lines).
    *   Links: GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook (Each with a subtle hover effect, e.g., a color shift or a 3D skew).

**Footer:**

*   "Designed with ❤️ by AI (This project would not have been written without the help of AI.)" (Smaller font, subdued color).
*   "Site design initiated by [Your Name]".
*   Stopwatch: A minimalist digital-style timer displaying "Time Since Genesis: HH:MM:SS" using a high-contrast font, updated every second via JavaScript.

**Interactions and Animations:**

*   Subtle hover effects on links and project cards.
*   Smooth scrolling between sections.
*   The background gradient should breathe and animate slightly, adding a dynamic feel.
* The page loads with a smooth fade-in animation for the top part.

**Technical Considerations:**

*   Use a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, or Svelte) for componentization and dynamic data handling.
*   Employ GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for smooth, performant animations.
*   Optimize images and code for fast loading times.
*   Ensure accessibility with semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
*   Clean clear CSS for easy adaptation by AI.
