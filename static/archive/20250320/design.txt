## Website Design: Geva Kipper - AI Re-Imagined Portfolio

**Overall Concept:** A dynamic, visually striking single-page portfolio utilizing a split-screen aesthetic and a constantly evolving style influenced by AI-generated design elements. Each day, sections of the page, such as color scheme, fonts, and small animations, subtly change, offering a fresh experience.

**Header Section:** The page opens with a full-width header. On the left side, prominently display "Geva Kipper" in a clean, modern typeface (e.g., Montserrat, Open Sans). Underneath, a concise statement: "Software Engineer at Google." Below that, a sub-header in a smaller, elegant font: "Re-designed daily by AI." A subtle, animated gradient or parallax effect can be added to the background of the header to provide dynamism.

**Split-Screen Main Content:** The main content area is divided into two vertical sections. These sections do not have to be equal in size.

**Left Section (Project Showcases):** This section features the project boxes.

*   **Box 1: GlglStats:** Title: "GlglStats." Description: "Measures repetitiveness of Israeli pop-chart songs based on LZ77 compression. Visualizes repetition patterns in famous songs." A striking visual element could be an abstract representation of LZ77 compression, or a visual waveform with highlighted repetitive sections. A clear call to action: "Visit the project" linked to https://glglstats.onrender.com/. A small thumbnail-sized embedded YouTube player displays Geva presenting the project.

*   **Box 2: Ahuzat Dibuk:** Title: "Ahuzat Dibuk." Description: "Collecting statistics for Tel-Aviv car parking lots, generating heat-maps for residents." The visual element could be a stylized heatmap representing parking lot occupancy. Call to action: "Read about the project" with links to the 13tv, Mako, and Facebook URLs below each other in a list.

**Right Section (Project Showcases, Meta-Portfolio & Footer):**

*   **Box 3: Meta-Portfolio:** Title: "This Very Site." Description: "An ever-evolving portfolio, crafted with code and re-imagined daily by AI." The visual element could feature a swirling, animated representation of code morphing into abstract design elements. Call to Action: "See what I did before!"

*   **Box 4: Get in Touch:** This box is simpler and includes icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, each linked to the respective profile. Below it, a brief description: "Connect with me."

**Footer:** At the very bottom of the page, a dark, subtle bar includes the following: `Designed by [AI Model Name]`. `Maintained by Geva Kipper`. To the right, a prominent digital stopwatch counting up from `2025-03-20 13:35:04`, displayed with clear hour, minute, and second readouts. The stopwatch has a modern, minimalist design.

**Visual Style:**

*   **Color Palette:** The initial color scheme is a muted, elegant combination of modern neutral colors, like: deep indigo and light sand, with an accent of mint green. 
*   **Typography:** Clean, readable fonts are important.
*   **Animations:** Subtle animations are used throughout the site to highlight interactivity and give the site a sense of life. Examples: Hover effects, animated gradients, the stopwatch, and dynamic AI-generated design elements.
*   **Responsiveness:** The layout is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes.

The AI's "re-design" should influence aspects like color accents, font pairings, micro-interactions, and background patterns each day, providing a unique and evolving portfolio experience.
