# Digital Garden Portfolio Design Concept

## Overall Theme
A digital garden where code and projects grow like plants. The background gradually transitions from deep soil color at the bottom to a light sky blue at the top. Small animated code snippets (represented as glowing seedlings or sprouts) occasionally pop up from the bottom and float upward across the screen.

## Header
- **Name**: "Geva Kipper" displayed in a modern, clean sans-serif font at the top center
- **Subtitle**: A single line explaining his current work at Google in a slightly smaller font
- **AI Notice**: A subtle, elegant banner beneath the header that reads: "This digital garden is re-designed daily by AI and is ever-changing." The text has a slight shimmer effect.

## Main Garden Area
The four project sections appear as different types of plants or garden elements, growing from the soil:

### GlglStats Section
Visualized as a musical flower with petals made of audio waveforms. When hovered, the flower blooms further revealing:
- Project description about measuring repetitiveness in Israeli pop songs
- Links displayed as leaves sprouting from the stem
- Video thumbnail appears as a special bloom on the plant

### Ahuzat Dibuk Section
Represented as a heat-map tree with parking-lot inspired branches. The heat-map uses red-to-blue coloration:
- Project description appears when hovering near the trunk
- News story links appear as leaves with subtle newspaper texture
- The Facebook link appears as a special blue fruit hanging from a branch

### Portfolio Website Section (Meta)
Visualized as a recursive plant that contains miniature versions of the other plants within its structure:
- Self-referential design with fractal-like elements
- Link appears as a reflective pool beneath the plant
- When hovered, the plant slightly rotates to reveal its recursive nature

### Social Links Section
Appears as a garden signpost with three directional signs pointing to different paths:
- GitHub sign has small code branch decorations
- LinkedIn sign has professional connection nodes
- Facebook sign has a subtle social network visualization

## Animation and Interactivity
- Plants gently sway as if in a breeze
- When hovering over a section, that plant grows slightly larger and emits a soft glow
- Small code snippets (represented by glowing particles) occasionally float up from the soil
- Scrolling down makes you "dig deeper" into the garden, with roots becoming visible

## Footer
Contains:
- A credit line: "Garden cultivated by [AI Model Name]" with a subtle AI-inspired icon
- An elegant stopwatch counting time since 2025-03-23 06:13:40, displayed as "Garden growing for XX hours, XX minutes, XX seconds"
- The stopwatch digits resemble a digital plant growth counter

## Responsive Behavior
On smaller screens, the garden transforms into a vertical arrangement where plants grow upward in sequence, maintaining the digital garden metaphor while ensuring usability.
