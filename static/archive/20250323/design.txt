Okay, here's a design concept for Geva Kipper's portfolio website, based on an "old-style navigation" theme but with a modern, AI-driven twist:

**Overall Theme:** A user interface that evokes the feeling of navigating a physical directory or card catalog. Think polished wood, tactile elements, and a sense of discovery.

**Page Structure:** Single page, with smooth scrolling transitions between sections. The entire site adopts a slightly off-white or cream background to feel aged.

**Header:**

*   **Developer's Name:** "Geva Kipper" prominently displayed in a classic, slightly serifed font (like Garamond or Times New Roman), perhaps with a subtle faux-embossing effect to simulate a letterpress print.
*   **Subtitle:** Directly beneath Geva's name: "Software Engineer at Google." in a smaller, regular sans-serif font.
* "AI Re-designed daily." This single line is written smaller underneath the previous line.

**Main Content - Four "Card Catalog" Boxes:**

The heart of the design is four distinct, rectangular boxes, similar to the drawers in an old card catalog cabinet.

*   **Box Appearance:** Each box has a slightly raised, beveled edge to simulate depth. A subtle shadow effect reinforces the 3D illusion. The "wood" texture should be restrained and high-resolution, not overly distracting. The color should mimic light, aged wood.
*   **Box Arrangement:** Arranged in a visually balanced grid (maybe 2x2 or a single row depending on screen sizes), with slight spacing between them.
*   **Content Display:**
    *   Each box has a "title card" area at the top, resembling a card from the catalog featuring the project name in bold.
    *   Below the title card is the project description, written as a short, concise 'card' in a typewriter-like font, giving the impression of typed information.
    *   Links are presented simply as underlined text or subtle button shaped with an old-looking cursor on hover.
    *   The 'GlglStats' box integrates the YouTube video via a small, embedded player. It could use a film-strip graphic as a play button.

**Section Specifics:**

1.  **GlglStats:** Title card reads "GlglStats Project." Text describes the project. Links to website (https://glglstats.onrender.com/). Embedded YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo). A small waveform below the video might be nice.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** Title card reads "Ahuzat Dibuk Project." Text describes the project. Links to news stories (https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/, https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm) and Facebook publication (https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/).

3.  **Portfolio Website:** Title card reads "Portfolio Website (Meta!)." Text describes the project. Link to self (https://portfolio-dor1.onrender.com/).

4.  **Connect:** Title card reads "Connect." This box contains simple icons or stylized text links to GitHub (https://github.com/gevak), LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/gevakip), and Facebook.

**Footer:**

*   Located subtly at the very bottom of the page, in a smaller, unobtrusive font.
*   "Designed by: [Your Name]".
*   "AI Contributor: [AI Model Name]".
*   Stopwatch: A small, retro-style digital stopwatch or mechanical-style animated clock visualization that counts up from "2025-03-23 01:01:40", displayed with hours, minutes, and seconds. The stopwatch can be subtle yet noticeable.

**Interactivity and Aesthetics:**

*   Subtle hover effects on the boxes (e.g., a slight darkening or a shadow extension) to indicate interactivity.
*   Smooth scrolling transitions between sections when links are clicked.
*   Responsive design that adapts well to different screen sizes while maintaining the "card catalog" look.
*   Animations are understated and elegant, enhancing the user experience without being distracting. E.g., fading in the elements of each box, or changing the card catalog icon on hover.

**Overall Impression:**

A unique and memorable way to showcase Geva Kipper's work. The "old-style navigation" theme provides a charming and engaging browsing experience, while the AI-driven twist in the subtitle adds a touch of novelty and intrigue. The site appears sophisticated, well-designed, and distinctly personal.
