# Design Concept: Blockchain-Inspired Portfolio for Geva Kipper

## Overall Theme
A blockchain-inspired single-page portfolio where each project is represented as a block in a chain. The blocks are connected with animated lines that simulate the blockchain linkage. The background should be a subtle grid pattern in dark mode with occasional hexagonal data particles floating across the screen.

## Header Section
- Name "Geva Kipper" in a bold, modern sans-serif font (like Montserrat) with a gradient effect from blue to teal
- Subtitle: "Currently building search infrastructure at Google."
- Secondary subtitle in a smaller, slightly faded font: "This website is re-designed daily by AI and is perpetually evolving."
- A stylized blockchain icon next to the name that subtly animates when hovered

## Navigation
- A minimalist horizontal navigation bar with glowing node-like indicators
- Smooth scroll functionality to each project block when clicked

## Project Blocks Layout
Four interconnected hexagonal blocks arranged in a vertical chain, each with a visual "hash" connection to the next. Each block should expand slightly when hovered, with a subtle glow effect resembling blockchain verification.

## Block 1: GlglStats
- Header in blockchain-style font with a waveform icon
- Brief description of the project measuring repetitiveness in Israeli pop songs
- Two buttons styled as "verification nodes":
  - "Visit Project" (linking to https://glglstats.onrender.com/)
  - "Watch Presentation" (linking to YouTube presentation)
- A small audio visualization that responds to hover, representing the song analysis concept

## Block 2: Ahuzat Dibuk
- Header with a parking/map pin icon
- Brief description about the Tel-Aviv parking statistics project
- A miniature heat map visualization that subtly animates
- Three buttons styled as blockchain transaction links:
  - "News Coverage 1" and "News Coverage 2" (linking to the news stories)
  - "Original Publication" (linking to the Facebook post)

## Block 3: Portfolio Website
- A recursive, meta-design with nested blocks inside this block
- Description mentioning the self-referential nature
- "Visit Current Instance" button linking to the portfolio site
- A small animation showing the website refreshing/changing to represent its AI-evolution concept

## Block 4: Connect
- Social links displayed as blockchain nodes in a horizontal arrangement
- Each link (GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook) has its respective icon
- The nodes pulse with a subtle glow effect when hovered
- The links animate as if they're being verified on the blockchain when clicked

## Footer
- Credit line: "Design generated by [Your AI Model Name]"
- A blockchain-styled digital stopwatch showing time elapsed since 2025-03-28 00:58:43
- The time display resembles a block timestamp with animated ticking seconds

## Interactive Elements
- Parallax scrolling effect on the blockchain connection lines
- When scrolling, blocks appear to be "mined" with a brief verification animation
- Hover states include subtle color shifts and expanded information
- Each block has a unique "hash" visual element that changes when interacted with

## Color Scheme
- Primary: Deep navy background (#0A192F)
- Secondary: Teal accents (#64FFDA)
- Tertiary: Soft purple highlights (#C770F0)
- Text: Light gray (#CCD6F6) and white (#E6F1FF)
- Block backgrounds: Semi-transparent with subtle gradient overlays

## Typography
- Headings: Monospace font resembling code (like Fira Code)
- Body text: Clean sans-serif (like Inter)
- Accent text: Tech-inspired display font for project titles
