The portfolio would be a single, vertically scrolling page with a smooth parallax effect. Dominant colors would be shades of deep cyan and white for text, giving an airy, tech-focused feel.

The page opens with "Geva Kipper" in a large, clean sans-serif font center-aligned at the top. Beneath, “Software Engineer at Google.” in a smaller, slightly lighter weight font. Directly under, a thin, italicized line reads: "This website is redesigned daily by AI, embracing constant evolution."

Next, the four project sections are stacked vertically. Each occupies roughly the same screen height. Backgrounds are slightly offset shades of cyan, creating visual separation.

Each section follows a similar layout but with varying slight tilts for visual interest: A heading in bold white text, the project name and a brief description, both left-aligned. A subtle, animated line underlines the description. Underneath, the key links will be displayed as tactile, glowing buttons. These buttons utilize hover effects.

For 'GlglStats', display a cropped, blurred, and dark photograph showing the PyData TLV conference video in the background. The video link and github link will be prominent, while the picture acts to draw the eye.

For 'Ahuzat Dibuk', use a similarly cropped photograph. This time showing some of the heat-maps that were generated. The link is still very visible, and designed to appear like a button.

The self-reference to https://portfolio-dor1.onrender.com/ also has an equally prominent link. The project title will be called 'Portfolio Project' - a portfolio of a portfolio! Use a screenshot of the original site behind the description.

Finally, the link to github, linked in, and Facebook, will be in cyan color, glow on hover.

At the bottom of the page, a simple white footer with nearly invisible cyan lines will contain: "Created by [AI Model Name]". Below that, displayed in a monospace font, is the stopwatch, updating in real-time, showing the time elapsed since "2025-03-21 00:57:43". The stopwatch will have a very gentle pulsing animation to reinforce its active nature.
