Here’s a design concept for Geva Kipper’s AI-powered, ever-changing portfolio website:
## Overall Aesthetic:

Clean, minimalist with an "algorithmic art" vibe. Think a canvas where AI experiments with layouts, colour palettes, and typography each day, resulting in subtle but noticeable daily transformations. Use a dark background with light (but not harsh) text for readability and a modern feel.

## Structure:

Single-page layout, dynamically updated, using a grid system.

## Elements:

### Header:

*   **Developer's Name:** "Geva Kipper" displayed prominently in a clean, modern typeface. A subtle animated effect (like a slight gaussian blur that shifts) would emphasize the dynamic nature.
*   **Subtitle:** "A Software Engineer at Google" positioned beneath the name. Keep the text subtle.
*   **Ever-Changing Website Note:** Below the first two lines: ”Re-designed daily by Artificial Intelligence. Come back tomorrow to see what changed.”

### Content Boxes (Presenting Projects):

These are the four core sections. Each box should have the following structure:

*   **Box Shape:** all boxes have a similar shape. For example rectangular boxes with slightly rounded corners.
*   **Visual Cue:** Each box contains a simple, abstract icon that represents the project's essence (e.g., GlglStats – a waveform, Ahuzat Dibuk – a parking space icon, the meta portfolio project – a stylized monitor screen). The icon should be AI-generated (using an API that delivers it on-the-fly).
*   **Title:** the Project name (GlglStats, Ahuzat Dibuk, Meta-Portfolio) will be in a bold, sans-serif font.
*   **Description:** Concise text description, ideally generated/edited with AI for variations over time.
*   **Links:** Styled buttons or links to external resources (GlglStats site, news articles, Facebook post, self-reference). Links in a specific font to set them apart.

**Colour coding:** Each box get assigned a primary colour, chosen at random when the website loads. These colours can shift slightly over time.

**Box 1: GlglStats**. A background visual could display a very simplified visual example of an LZ77 compression, but not too busy.

**Box 2: Ahuzat Dibuk**. A subtle heatmap overlayed on a Tel-Aviv map (slightly blurred) as a background image.

**Box 3: Meta-Portfolio**. Keep the design clean, drawing attention to the irony of AI designing the design, but not distracting from the rest of the information.

**Box 4: Social Links**. Standard icons for GitHub and LinkedIn, and Facebook, aligned horizontally within the box. Use Geva's profile picture for all links.

### Footer:

*   **Credits:** "Designed by: [AI Model Name] (generated using prompt by Designer)" This should be subtly placed.
*   **Stopwatch:** A live stopwatch, very discreetly styled, displaying the time elapsed since "2025-03-21 15:24:22".

## Visual & Animation:

*   **Subtle Animations:** Use subtle CSS animations for transitions and hover effects. Every element should have a little "life".
*   **Typeface:** Use two clean, modern sans-serif fonts for the main text and the links. The font for links should be slightly more industrial looking. The fonts should change slightly on each reload.
*   **Colour Palette:** Limited to 3-4 colours (including the black / dark grey background) that change slightly each day. Colour selection can be loosely themed (e.g., "Pastel Day", "Monochrome Day").
*   **Grid Layout:** the position of the grid can change slightly each day. The changes must be consistent.
*   **Theme Toggles**: Include a theme selector, and an AI suggestion for the next theme toggle.

## Responsiveness:

The site is should be responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes.
