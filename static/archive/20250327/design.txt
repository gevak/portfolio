# Blockchain-Inspired Portfolio Design for Geva Kipper

## Core Concept
A single-page portfolio that visually resembles a blockchain, with each project section appearing as a "block" in the chain. Each block has a timestamp, hash visualization, and connects to the next block with animated lines representing cryptographic links.

## Layout & Navigation
- Dark background with glowing neon blue/green accent colors
- Large header with Geva Kipper's name in a monospace font, resembling a terminal
- Subtitle in smaller text explaining the AI-generated nature of the site that changes daily
- A subtle hexagonal grid background pattern suggesting a distributed network
- A vertical blockchain of four project blocks that users scroll through

## Block Design
Each project block appears as a 3D-rendered cube with:
- Project title displayed on the "face" of the cube in tech-inspired typography
- A unique animated "hash" visualization (abstract geometric pattern) for each project
- Timestamp showing when the project was created (in blockchain format)
- Blocks connected by glowing lines with small animated data packets traveling between blocks

## Interaction Elements
- As users scroll, blocks rotate slightly to reveal more information
- Each block has a "Verify" button that triggers a satisfying animation showing the project's authenticity
- Links within blocks glow on hover with a subtle pulse effect
- When clicking a link, an animation shows the data being "signed" before redirecting

## Special Features
- A terminal-style command line at the bottom where visitors can type simple commands to navigate
- A mini visualization of the blockchain in the corner that serves as a navigation element
- Each project section has a unique color scheme while maintaining the overall aesthetic
- The stopwatch at the bottom displays time in a hexadecimal format alongside standard format

## Footer
- Minimalist footer with AI credit in terminal-style font
- The stopwatch counting time since 2025-03-27 00:58:30 visualized as both a digital counter and a mini blockchain growing in real-time
- A subtle easter egg where clicking the stopwatch shows a full validation of the site's "blocks"

## Responsive Behavior
- On mobile, the blockchain transforms from vertical to a more compact accordion-style interface
- Touch gestures allow users to "rotate" each block to see different sides with more information
- Simplified animations for performance on mobile devices while maintaining the core aesthetic
