## Geva Kipper's Portfolio: Interactive Data Visualization

**Overall Theme:** Modern, minimalist, and visually driven by data. The website feels like a living data landscape. Soft, desaturated color palette (think blues, greys, and whites) with pops of primary color highlighting interactive elements.

**Hero Section:**

*   Large, clean typography for the name "Geva Kipper" at the top. Below it: "Software Engineer at Google."
*   Subtitle in smaller, italicized font: "This portfolio is redesigned by AI daily, a constantly evolving snapshot of my skills."
*   The background is a subtle, animated data visualization. Think a flowing stream of abstract shapes representing data points. This stream could be subtly influenced by cursor position.

**Main Content Sections (Skillset as Data Visualizations):**

Each of the four sections is presented as a distinct visual element, with interactivity built in.

1.  **GlglStats:**
    *   Presentation format: A dynamic, interactive waveform visualization representing song segments.
    *   Clicking on a segment in the waveform highlights the identified repeated patterns, using color coding.
    *   Title: "GlglStats: Measuring Musical Repetition."
    *   Short description: "Analyzes repetitiveness in Israeli pop chart songs using LZ77 compression."
    *   "View live" button linking to the GlglStats website.
    *   Embedded thumbnail image with a play button for the PyData TLV presentation video. On click, the video opens in a modern lightbox.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:**
    *   Presentation format: A heatmap visualization of Tel-Aviv parking spot occupancy.
    *   Data points pulse gently.
    *   Title: "Ahuzat Dibuk: Real-Time Parking Data Visualization."
    *   Short description: "Collecting and visualizing Tel-Aviv parking lot statistics for resident use."
    *   Buttons linking to the news articles and Facebook post, with subtle icons next to the button text.

3.  **Portfolio Website (Self-Referential):**
    *   Presentation format: A simplified, interactive wireframe model of the current portfolio website. Each section of the wireframe is subtly highlighted on hover.
    *   Title: "Portfolio Website (This Site!)"
    *   Short description: "A living portfolio, redesigned daily by AI using data visualization and interactive design."
    *   A "Explore this site" button takes the user to the top of the page, creating a seamless loop.

4.  **Links:**
    *   Presentation format: A network graph, where each platform (GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook) is a node. The links between the nodes subtly animate, showing connections.
    *   The logos of the mentioned platforms will be used as node icons.
    *   Title: "Connect with Me."
    *   Buttons to LinkedIn, GitHub and Facebook. Upon hover, the connected nodes of the network graph should be emphasized.

**Overall Layout:**

*   Clean, grid-based layout with generous spacing.
*   Smooth scrolling between sections.
*   The entire page subtly reacts to mouseover events, creating a sense of responsiveness without excessive animation.

**Footer:**

*   Small, minimalist text.
*   "Designed with the assistance of [AI Model Name]."
*   "Created by [Your Name]".
*   Stopwatch: A subtle, analog-style clock face counting upwards from March 22, 2025 17:49:03. Display Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds.
*   Sticky footer, always visible at the bottom of the screen.

**Typography:**

*   Modern, clean sans-serif font. Use different weights and sizes to create visual hierarchy.

**Color Palette:**

*   Primarily cool and light colors like #f0f8ff (AliceBlue), #e6e6e6 (Gainsboro), and #d3d3d3 (LightGray) for backgrounds and containers.
*   Accents of a single, vibrant primary color (e.g., #007bff or #28a745) for interactive elements and key information. This color should be used sparingly to draw attention.
