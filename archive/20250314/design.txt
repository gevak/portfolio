## Design for Geva Kipper's Ever-Changing Portfolio

The site adopts a duotone aesthetic, primarily using a muted teal (#468499) as the main background color and a contrasting, lighter beige (#F5F5DC) for content sections. The overall feeling should be clean and modern, with a subtle organic feel.

Geva Kipper's name is prominently displayed at the top in a large, sans-serif font (e.g., Montserrat or Open Sans), with the Google affiliation sentence directly underneath in a smaller, italicized font. Below this, the "Redesigned Daily by AI" subtitle appears in a smaller, almost ephemeral font, maybe with slight transparency, hinting at the website's transient nature.

The four portfolio sections are presented as overlapping, slightly rotated boxes arranged diagonally on the page. Each box is beige coloured except it includes a subtle teal border and a soft drop shadow. Text is aligned to the left inside each boxes. 'GlglStats' will have the video embedded, as a wide rectangle, and below it the link. 'Ahuzat dibuk' will present the links simply.
'Portfolio' will show the links below a short "This Site" heading. Box 4 will include icon links next to 'GitHub, LinkedIn and Facebook'.

All boxes should be roughly the same width and height, but slight random variations in size daily would be a nice touch. The diagonal placement should feel casual, not rigidly structured.

At the bottom, the copyright line ("Â© Grok and Claude") is displayed in a very small font, using teal on beige box rather than teh large background. The stopwatch begins its time-lapse unobtrusively, using a compact digital-style font, placed to the opposite site. It's styled to feel integrated into the copyright information to the eye despite being in it's own little background box.

As a final touch, the AI randomness will add a touch of visual interest. One or two small graphic elements may appear in random positions (e.g., a simple geometric shape, or a line drawing inspired by machine learning visualizations), changing daily. These elements should be kept extremely subtle so as not to overcrowd the design.
