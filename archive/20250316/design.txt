## Portfolio Website Design for Geva Kipper

**Overall Concept:** A dynamically generated, evolving portfolio with a playful, yet sophisticated aesthetic. The site embraces AI generation as a core element, creating a sense of surprise and continuous discovery.

**Visuals:** The site uses a clean, pastel color palette (think shades of mint green, light peach, and sky blue) with a sans-serif font like "Nunito" or "Open Sans". Gradient backgrounds are used sparingly to add depth, not distraction. A subtle, animated generative art piece (think subtle moving lines or shapes) runs constantly in the background, reinforcing the AI redesign concept.

**Layout:** A single, vertically scrolling page. The main section is divided into four distinct "blocks" or sections, each presented as a slightly tilted or rotated card on the screen. The cards expand smoothly on hover or click to reveal more details.

**Hero Section:** Large, centered heading: "Geva Kipper". Subtitle below: "AI-redesigned daily; expect the unexpected!". Below the subtitle, a single sentence: "Software Engineer at Google, working on [current work, placeholder, to be updated]."

**Project Blocks:**

1.  **GlglStats:** Card with a stylized graphic representing sound waves or data visualization. Hovering reveals a short description and prominent links to the website (https://glglstats.onrender.com/) and YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo). When the video is opened from the page this should be done in a popup player so the website is still visible in the background.

2.  **Ahuzat Dibuk:** Card featuring a miniature, abstract Tel Aviv heatmap. Hovering reveals a short description and links to news articles on Mako: (https://www.mako.co.il/nexter-news/Article-ae43964b891bf71027.htm) and 13TV: (https://13tv.co.il/item/news/domestic/internal/parking-902956407/) as well as a Facebook post (https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/posts/10159636301195943/). On hover the card shows the links.

3.  **Portfolio Website:** A card designed to reference reflection. Maybe use a mirror-like effect, or a recursive visual. Short description stating it's *this very website*. Link provided: https://gevak.github.io/portfolio/.

4.  **Connect:** A card displaying icons representing GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook. On hover the icons grow larger and the links are revealed:
    *   GitHub: (https://github.com/gevak)
    *   LinkedIn: (www.linkedin.com/in/gevakip)

**Footer:**

A simple horizontal bar at the bottom of the page. Left-aligned text: "Â© Grok & Claude". Right-aligned, prominent stopwatch ticking upwards, displaying time since 2025-03-16 01:00:47 in Hours:Minutes:Seconds.
