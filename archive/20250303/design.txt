## Design for Geva Kipper's Portfolio Website

**Overall Concept:** A dynamic, generative art portfolio presented as a series of interconnected, almost floating elements on a dark backdrop. The ever-changing nature of the AI redesign should be subtly reflected in the layout and visual elements; a feeling of controlled chaos and generative evolution.

**Visual Style:** Modern, minimalist, dark theme. Use a monospace font family.

**Page Structure:** Single page, modular design.

**Header:**

*   **Top Center:**  "Geva Kipper" – larger font size. Smaller beneath: "Software Engineer at Google."
*   **Sub-title:** Below Geva's sentence, a smaller, italicized line: *"This portfolio is redesigned daily by AI."*

**Sections ('Boxes'):**

Each section represents a project. Each project has its own geometric shape and appears floating. These shapes are interconnected.

*   **GlglStats:**
    *   Shape: Irregular polygon.
    *   Content: "GlglStats" title. Brief description: "Measures repetitiveness of Israeli pop chart songs based on LZ77 compression. Visualizes repetition patterns."
    *   Active Links: 'Visit the Website' ([https://glglstats.onrender.com/](https://glglstats.onrender.com/)), 'PyData TLV Presentation' ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKAtOsj1Lo)). Hover effect on the box changes the color scheme of that box.

*   **Ahuzat Dibuk:**
    *   Shape: Circles of varying sizes clustered together. Size of circle reflects the popularity/hits on the link.
    *   Content: "Ahuzat Dibuk" title. Brief description: "Collects statistics for Tel-Aviv car parking lots, generating heatmaps for residents."
    *   Active Links: Include 3 links to sources. Each link is a circle. Hover effect expands/pulsates the source.

*   **Portfolio Website:**
    *   Shape: The container has a grid-like mesh.
    *   Content: "Portfolio Website" title.  Brief description: "This very website." The mesh rotates slowly via CSS.
    *   Self-Reference Link: "[https://www.geekipp.er](https://www.geekipp.er)" - Highlight this (e.g., neon effect).

*   **Connect:**
    *   Shape: A stylized constellation.
    *   Content: Labeled icon links for "GitHub", "LinkedIn", "Facebook."
    *   Active Links: GitHub ([https://github.com/gevak](https://github.com/gevak)), LinkedIn ([www.linkedin.com/in/gevakip)), Facebook (No Link, icon only). Each icon pulses gently.

**Page Footer:**

*   **Bottom Left:** "© 2024 Grok & Claude."
*   **Bottom Right:** Functioning Stopwatch. Display format: "HH:MM:SS since 2025-03-03 18:49:27". Digital font-style. Color should match the "Portfolio Website" link color.
