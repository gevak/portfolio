## Portfolio Website Design: Geva Kipper

**Overall Aesthetic:** Clean, modern, and slightly whimsical. A balance between professional and playful, reflecting the AI-driven ever-changing nature of the site. A muted color palette with one bright accent color that changes daily.

**Layout:** Single-page, vertically scrolled. The page is conceptually divided into four horizontal sections, each containing one of the four project boxes. Sections transition smoothly on scroll, potentially with subtle parallax effects.

**First Section (Header/Intro):**

*   **Background:** A dynamically generated geometric pattern or a subtle gradient that shifts colors daily.
*   **Content:**
    *   Centered prominently: "Geva Kipper" in a clean, modern font.
    *   Beneath, a single sentence: "Software Engineer at Google," in a smaller, slightly lighter font.
    *   Immediately following: "This website is reimagined daily by AI." in a smaller, italicized font.

**Project Boxes (Sections 2-5):**

*   **Structure:** Each project presented in a distinct box. Boxes have rounded edges and slight shadows.
*   **"GlglStats" Box:**
    *   **Visual:** Still from the PyData TLV video framed artfully, perhaps with a subtle hover effect that enhances the frame. Title overlay: "GlglStats."
    *   **Description:** Concise blurb summarizing the project's concept (repetition in Israeli pop music via LZ77).
    *   **Links:** Prominent button labeled "Visit Site" (to https://glglstats.onrender.com/) and a smaller icon link to the YouTube video.
*   **"Ahuzat Dibuk" Box:**
    *   **Visual:** A blurred heat map graphic representing Tel-Aviv parking density with key parking lots made prominent. Title overlay: "Ahuzat Dibuk."
    *   **Description:** Short description of the project's purpose (Tel Aviv parking statistics for residents).
    *   **Links:** Three smaller icon links to the 13tv news story, the Mako article, and the Facebook post.
*   **"Portfolio Website" Box:**
    *   **Visual:** An abstract, visual representation of code or an iteration on the landing page's geometric pattern. Title overlay: "Meta Portfolio."
    *   **Description:** "This very website, always evolving."
    *   **Link:** Single button: "View Source" (to https://gevak.github.io/portfolio/).
*   **"Socials" Box:**
    *   **Visual:** A stylized icon grid that morphs. Title overlay: "Social Links."
    *   **Description**: Nothing specific.
    *   **Links:** Large, clear social media icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook) with hover effects to the target sites.

**Footer:**

*   **Copyright:** Located at the bottom, small font: "Â© Copyright Reserved to Grok & Claude".
*   **Stopwatch:** Positioned beside the copyright notice. A simple, clean digital-style timer displaying elapsed time (hours, minutes, seconds) since "2025-03-09 00:48:42".
*   **Dynamic Element:** The accent color from the first section should also be used to highlight the stopwatch's display for visual consistency.

**Overall Interactions:**

*   Subtle hover effects on all interactive elements (buttons, links, project boxes).
*   Smooth scrolling between sections.
*   The geometric pattern background should subtly and slowly animate.

**Accessibility Considerations:**

*   Sufficient color contrast throughout the design.
*   Keyboard navigability.
*   Alt text for all images.

**Typography:**

*   Clean, readable font for body text.
*   Slightly bolder and more modern font for headings.

**Responsiveness:** The design should be fully responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
