**Overall Aesthetic:**
High Contrast, Brutalist Minimalism meets playful AI randomness. Think clean lines and bold typography but with unexpected visual quirks generated on each page load. The color palette will heavily rely on black and white with a single accent color scheme that dynamically changes daily with the AI redesign - today it is a vibrant cyan.

**Header:** Stick to left-aligned blocks for the header:
*   **Geva Kipper** (Large, bold, sans-serif typeface): Software Engineer at Google.
*   Subtitle: Redesigned daily by AI.

**Structure:**
The main content area is a responsive grid containing the four project boxes. Each box is visually distinct (due to the AI influence) but shares a unifying minimalist style. Hover effects are subtle, maybe a slight zoom or a change in the accent color.

**Project Boxes:**
Boxes will have a unified style of black background and simple white borders (in the form of a rectangle) .
Project GlglStats:
*   Title: GlglStats
*   Brief description.
*   Embedded thumbnail of the YouTube video (with a simple play icon).
*   Call to action link: "View Project" (leading to the project website in a new tab).
PyData TLV Presentation below the View project link.
*   Call to action link: "View Presentation" (leading to the presentation in a new tab).

Project Ahuzat Dibuk:
*   Title: Ahuzat Dibuk
*   Brief description.
*   Visual: Instead of a standard image, consider a dynamically generated heatmap snippet using a library like Leaflet, stylized to match the site’s aesthetic.
*   Call to action link: "Read About It" (opens news links in new tabs).
*   Call to action link: "Original FB post" (opens Facebook post link in new tabs).

Portfolio Website:
*   Title: This Website
*   Brief description (explaining that this is the current portfolio site).
*   Visual: A static thumbnail of the portfolio (responsive), with a playful "Meta!" overlay on hover.
*   Call to action link: "View Original Version" (links to the original portfolio -  https://gevak.github.io/portfolio/).

Social Media:
*   Title: Connect
*   Icon-based links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook lined vertically along the box. Use simple, elegant icons.

**Footer**
A slim footer stretches across the bottom.
*   Left: © Grok & Claude. All Rights Reserved.
*   Right: Stylized stopwatch displaying elapsed time since 2025-03-06 00:56:05. Use a monospace font for the time display, and subtle animation to indicate it’s counting.

**AI-Driven Randomness:**
*   **Accent Color Palette:** The main accent color (currently cyan) is randomly selected each day and applied to links, hover effects, and subtle decorative elements.
*   **Grid Layout:** The exact dimensions and arrangement of the project boxes within the grid shift slightly each day, while maintaining overall responsiveness.
*   **Typography:** While the main font faces are relatively standard, subtle variations in font-weight, letter spacing, or text-transformations are introduced randomly. Think of slight artistic 'glitches' in the textual design.
* Minimal use of AI generated imagery and backgrounds.
