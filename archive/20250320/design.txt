Here's a design concept for Geva Kipper's ever-changing portfolio website:

**Overall Aesthetic:** Clean, futuristic, and slightly glitchy, reflecting the AI-driven dynamic content. A dark color palette (think deep blues, purples, and blacks) with neon accents (bright green or cyan for links and hover effects). The layout will adapt smoothly across different screen sizes.

**Initial Page Load:** The background will flash briefly in pure white before settling into the dark theme, creating a "reboot" effect that hints at its daily reinvention.

**Hero Section:** Geva Kipper's name in a bold, geometric font at the very top. Below, centered, "Software Engineer at Google." Then, a smaller subtitle: "*Re-designed daily by artificial intelligence.*" A single animated line, pixelating and reforming itself, underlines the name.

**Project Boxes:** All boxes are equal size, but their order changes daily. They use a card-style layout with rounded corners and a subtle neon border that glows on hover. Each takes up 25% of the width, with room for the boxes to wrap to the next line on different screen sizes.

*   **GlglStats:** Title in a clean, sans-serif face. A short description below. The project description should use a slightly distressed or pixelated font. Beneath the text, use a placeholder image from the site and a play button icon. On hover, the background changes to a slightly lighter color or displays a brief snippet of song analysis (pulled dynamically - if possible - from the linked site). Links placed at the very bottom will lead the user to the project url, and to the PyData TLV conference recording.

*   **Ahuzat Dibuk:** Similar card design to *GlglStats*, but displays a heat map image. On hover, the map will briefly brighten. Links embedded with thumbnails of the news articles and social media post.

*   **Portfolio Website:** A recursive design element. Text describes the current website being viewed. Link to portfolio website, using the current version of your portfolio as a thumbnail image.

*   **Social Links:** Clean, minimalist icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, arranged horizontally. Hovering over each icon will briefly display the username/profile name.

**Footer:** A fixed footer at the bottom of the page. On the left, "Â© Grok and Claude Reserved". On the right, a visually prominent digital stopwatch ticking up from 2025-03-20 00:56:08. The stopwatch digits should be large and use a monospace font. The background of the footer is slightly darker than the rest of the page with a subtle, repeating pattern that shifts slowly.
**Dynamic Elements:** CSS animations and transitions subtly applied to all elements to create a sense of movement and interactivity. For example, text could briefly skew or glitch during transitions between sections. Randomly chosen color accents will be used each day to enforce the idea of AI control & daily change.
